[official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

# Modularization

The **CubIT Android** app has been fully modularized.

There is the main modules dependency graph below:

We encapsulate all data-logic specific to each domain in data-modules.
But there is troubles when we want to have a database that have relations between domains.
For this purpose we have only DAO-interfaces in data-layers and its realization will be in one separate module - :source:database.
Also, I moved the datastore to the separate module too. This will help us if we want to rewrite this project in KMM.
